# How to Enable GitHub Pages for Your Portfolio

Follow these steps to make your portfolio live on GitHub Pages:

## Steps:

1. **Go to Your Repository**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/felixtheschool/MyPortfolio

2. **Access Settings**
   - Click on the "Settings" tab (top right of the repository page)

3. **Find Pages Section**
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section

4. **Configure Source**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - In the "Source" dropdown, select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Under "Branch":
     - Select "main" branch
     - Select "/ (root)" folder
     - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for Deployment**
   - GitHub will start building your site
   - This takes 1-2 minutes
   - Refresh the page after a minute

6. **Get Your Live URL**
   - Once deployed, you'll see a message at the top:
     "Your site is live at https://felixtheschool.github.io/MyPortfolio/"
   - This is your live portfolio URL!

## Verification:

- Visit the URL to see your live portfolio
- All features (dark mode, smooth scrolling, filtering) will work
- The site updates automatically when you push new commits

## Your Portfolio URLs:

- **Repository**: https://github.com/felixtheschool/MyPortfolio
- **Live Site**: https://felixtheschool.github.io/MyPortfolio/ (after enabling Pages)

## Troubleshooting:

If the page doesn't load:
- Wait a few more minutes (first deployment can take up to 10 minutes)
- Make sure index.html is in the root directory (it is!)
- Check the "Actions" tab to see deployment status
- Try clearing your browser cache

## Custom Domain (Optional):

If you want to use a custom domain like "yourname.com":
1. In the Pages settings, add your custom domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

**Note**: All your features including dark mode, project filtering, and animations will work perfectly on GitHub Pages!
